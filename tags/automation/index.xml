      <description>My deep desire to throw myself against brick walls has reared it&amp;rsquo;s ugly head once more. An Open Source project I work on has recently taken on another member from the community I work in. This meant no more simple FTP&amp;rsquo;ing over into our dev server. Now we needed shards. For each developer&amp;hellip; Otherwise we would start to cross streams as we worked on different parts of the project.</description>
